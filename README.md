# MYSR

### Idea behind the project
A revolutionary mobile application that aims to bridge the gap between generous donors and non-profit organizations, creating a seamless platform for individuals and organizations to come together and make a positive impact on the lives of those in need. This app is designed to facilitate the process of donating food, clothes, and other essentials to underprivileged individuals and communities.‚Ä®

### Uniqueness about the Innovation
Despite the fact that there is more than enough food produced worldwide to feed everyone, 811 million people still sleeping hungry every night due to a lack of money and access to food. While certain nonprofit organizations operate websites with similar aims, there is no universal platform that encompasses all such organizations. Furthermore, the absence of a dedicated mobile application for this purpose leaves room for increased accessibility and convenience, benefiting both donors and NGO

### How it helped the Organization
In addition to fulfilling our social responsibility through CSR activities for the underprivileged, we extend our impact by creating a digital platform that links those in need with potential helpers. This innovative approach bridges the gap between them, effectively addressing the issue of food waste.
